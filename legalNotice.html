<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<h3>Liability for Library Content</h3>
<p>
    The components and code within the ComponentMelt library were developed with great care. However, we cannot provide a guarantee for the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of the code for any specific end-use application. 
    As the provider, we are responsible for the original content of this library, but we are not obliged to monitor third-party implementations or investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity resulting from the misuse of these components. 
    Our responsibility for the removal or blocking of information under general legal provisions remains unaffected. Liability is only accepted from the date of knowledge of a specific, notified infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will update or remove the affected components as soon as possible.
</p>

<h3>Liability for External Dependencies and Links</h3>
<p>
    Our documentation and library may contain links to external websites or third-party package repositories over which we have no control; therefore, we cannot accept liability for the content or security of these external resources. 
    The respective provider or operator is solely responsible for the content of linked sites or hosted packages. All links were checked for potential violations at the time of inclusion, and no illegal content was identified. 
    Continuous monitoring of external links without concrete evidence of a violation is not feasible. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links or dependencies immediately.
</p>

<h3>Copyright and Licensing</h3>
<p>
    The source code, logic, and documentation on these websites are subject to copyright. Unless otherwise specified by an included software license (e.g., MIT, Apache), the reproduction, adaptation, or distribution of these components outside the limits of the law requires the written consent of the rights holder. 
    Where content in this library was not created by ComponentMelt, the copyrights of third parties are respected and identified accordingly. Should you become aware of any copyright infringement within our modules, please notify us, and we will rectify the issue as soon as possible upon verification.
